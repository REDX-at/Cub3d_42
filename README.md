Cub_3D is a graphics project that focuses on rendering a simple 3D environment using the MiniLibX library. The objective is to create a 3D game-like experience where the player navigates a maze, implementing a first-person view with raycasting for rendering the environment.

## Introduction
The Cub_3D project challenges students to build a 3D game environment using techniques like raycasting for graphics rendering. The project covers rendering textures, detecting collisions, and handling player movement, as well as managing window events and keyboard/mouse input.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Raycasting
Implement raycasting to render a 3D perspective based on a 2D map layout. Calculate rays cast from the player's position to detect walls and determine how to display the environment.

### 2. Textures and Sprites
Render textures on the walls of the environment, ensuring that different sides of the walls have distinct textures. Handle the loading and displaying of sprite images for objects in the game, such as torches or doors.

### 3. Player Movement
Implement smooth player movement with collision detection. Handle both keyboard input for movement (e.g., W, A, S, D) and mouse input for rotating the player’s view, simulating the first-person experience.

### 4. Minimap Display
Display a 2D minimap in the corner of the screen, showing the player’s position and the layout of the maze. Use different colors to represent walls, doors, and the player for a clear visualization.

### 5. Event Handling
Manage events such as key presses and mouse movements. Implement key hooks to handle movement, rotation, and interaction with objects, and mouse hooks to allow the player's view to follow the mouse cursor.

### 6. Error Handling
Ensure the program is robust with proper error handling for issues such as invalid map configurations, missing textures, or failure to initialize the MiniLibX library.

### Features
3D Rendering: Implement real-time 3D rendering using raycasting.
Texture Mapping: Apply textures to walls and render objects using sprites.
Player Movement: Handle player navigation with collision detection.
Minimap: Provide a top-down view of the map for easier navigation.
Event Handling: Manage keyboard and mouse inputs to control the player's actions.
